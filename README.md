## Local Development prerequisites

- Hugo (compatible with HugoBlox)
- Go (required for Hugo Modules)

Run the local development server:

```bash
hugo server
```

The site will be available at:

```bash
http://localhost:1313
```

## 🌍 Deployment

Production deployment is handled by Cloudflare Pages, connected directly to this repository.

Production branch: **main**

Build command:

```bash
pnpm install && hugo --gc --minify && pnpm dlx pagefind --source "public"
```

Output directory: **public**

Every push to main automatically triggers a new build and deployment.
